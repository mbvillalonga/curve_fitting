# curve_fitting

_This README is a work in progress and is updated in an ongoing fashion._

This repository contains Python scripts for performing curve fitting on experimental data. These scripts facilitate data analysis by fitting mathematical models to observed data points, estimating parameters, and visualizing fitted curves.

## Features

- **Flexible model fitting**: Supports linear, polynomial, and nonlinear curve fitting.
- **Customizable models**: Define custom mathematical functions to fit a variety of experimental data.
- **Goodness-of-fit metrics**: Includes R<sup>2</sup>, RMSE, and residual analysis to evaluate model performance.
- **Visualization tools**: Plots raw data alongside fitted curves for easy interpretations.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## Usage

(Coming soon)

## To do

1. Modularize scripts
2. Add file structure
3. Write setup.py / pyproject.toml
